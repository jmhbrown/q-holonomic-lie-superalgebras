  title={Branes and Supergroups}, volume={340}, ISSN={1432-0916}, url={https://doi.org/10.1007/s00220-015-2449-y}, DOI={10.1007/s00220-015-2449-y}, abstractNote={Extending previous work that involved D3-branes ending on a fivebrane with $${theta_{mathrm{YM}}neq 0}$$, we consider a similar two-sided problem. This construction, in case the fivebrane is of NS type, is associated to the three-dimensional Chern–Simons theory of a supergroup $${{rm U}(m|n)}$$or $${{rm OS}_{rm p}(m|2n)}$$rather than an ordinary Lie group as in the one-sided case. By S-duality, we deduce a dual magnetic description of the supergroup Chern–Simons theory; a slightly different duality, in the orthosymplectic case, leads to a strong-weak coupling duality between certain supergroup Chern–Simons theories on $${mathbb{R}^{3}}$$; and a further T-duality leads to a version of Khovanov homology for supergroups. Some cases of these statements are known in the literature. We analyze how these dualities act on line and surface operators.}, number={2}, journal={Communications in Mathematical Physics}, author={Mikhaylov, Victor and Witten, Edward}, year={2015}, month=dec, pages={699–832}, language={en} }
